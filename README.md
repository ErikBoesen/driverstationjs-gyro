# Gyroscope Widget addon for FRC Dashboard
Live updating, minimal gyro widget. Supports resetting to zero on click for calibration.

## Installation
1. Copy the contents of `gyro.html` to wherever in the dashboard you desire.
2. Copy the contents of `gyro.css` to `style.css` in the dashboard. Of course, you can put it anywhere else you would normally put CSS.
3. Copy the sections of `gyro.js` to where the comments above each section say they should go.
